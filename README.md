# 🚆 Project for BDJ ticket reservations 🚆

## 📝 Description

This project is a ticket reservation system for the BDJ railway company. It
allows users to book tickets for a given train and route, and to cancel their
reservations. It also allows the company to manage the trains and routes, and to
give discounts to users based on some criteria.

It was developed as a project for the course Validation and Verification of
Programming Systems at the Technical University of Sofia.

The main goal of the project was to implement a system and fully test it using
different techniques and tools like black-box testing and white-box testing. The
project was developed using the C# programming language and the .NET Core
framework. The tests were written using the NUnit testing framework.
